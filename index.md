##Summary

My name is Brigid Farinacci, I have recently returned to the U.S. after living
and working abroad for two years. As an English teacher in foreign countries, I
have gained certain skills that I would like to put toward a different role in
an industry new to me. The organizational, management, and leaderships skills
that I acquired while working for the businesses I have been working for, have
been gained through such experiences as going to a completely new country,
without any previous teaching experience, and standing in front of a group of
people who do not speak the same language as I.

All the schools I have worked for were not public schools, but in fact small
businesses, meaning that my role there required a high level of organization. In
both situations I was working in, there was the owner of the school and I.
Hence, I was teaching, leading, and organizing classes and programs on my own.
This involved multi-tasking, as I was to monitor and assist the progress of my
students, all of which had varying needs. I have been noted for my ability to
communicate in an easy to understand way by people of different cultures and
levels of English.

##Experience

a foreign language, as well as gaining confidence in doing so.

Using different skills to breach the language barrier and teach English without
proficient knowledge of Korean. I had to explain complicated grammar structures
across to young students who do not speak any English, and interact with
students of all ages on a personal level so we can gain a better understanding
of each other.

###English Teacher###

Kharms Moscow English Club

*September 2013 – January 2014*

*Moscow, Russian Federation*

The English native speaking teacher at an English club in Moscow, Russia. I had
to lead classes and discussions with Russian speakers learning English as a
foreign language. I taught a teen class and led adult club meetings.

Helping students become more comfortable and confident speaking English.
Teaching young students how to use English vocabulary and grammar.

Using communications skills to express lessons to those who can't understand
English perfectly. Breach the language and culture barrier with students of all

different ages and English levels.

language you speak naturally.

###English Instructor###

Moscow orphanage #59

*February 2013 - May 2013*

*Moscow, Russian Federation*

Leading a class in an orphanage in Moscow, Russia. The children had varying
English levels and were often struggling with their English classes in school. I
would give lessons to help them learn certain things in English and learn how to
say different things, and hopefully catch up on their classes. I would also
often privately tutor them, or help them with their lessons for school.

I helped children in an orphanage who came from different parts of Russia, and
therefore were often behind the other students in their public school's classes.
I would help them with their English classes, and hopefully make it easier for
them to learn and speak English.

Since many of the students spoke little to no English, and so did the
administrators of the orphanage, I had to use certain communication skills to
get passed this threshold. I wanted the children to become more confident in
English because many of them were struggling and had very low confidence and
drive to learn. I had to use good social skills to not only let them understand
me, but encourage them to want to learn.
